    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Ingredients
            <ul>
                <li>1 quart heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 vanilla bea, split and scraped</li>
                <li>1 cup vanilla sugar, divided</li>
                <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>2 quartz hot water</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>This makes a large pan of Creme Brulee.
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Place the cream, vanilla bean and its pulp into a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. </li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes. </li>
                <li>Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use. </li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. </li>
                <li>Add the cream a little at a time, stirring continually. </li>
                <li>Pour the liquid into 6 (7 to 8-ounce) ramekins. </li>
                <li>Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. </li>
                <li>Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. </li>
                <li>Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 40 to 45 minutes. </li>
                <li>Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. </li>
                <li>Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top. </li>
                <li>Divide the remaining 1/2 cup vanilla sugar equally among the 6 dishes and spread evenly on top. </li>
                <li>Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top. </li>
                <li>Allow the creme brulee to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
